# Skin Disease Classification Application

## Project Overview
This application provides a web-based interface for classifying skin diseases using machine learning models. It combines a React frontend with Python backend scripts for image analysis.

## 🔍 Features

- **Intuitive File Upload Interface**  
  Upload skin disease images easily through a clean and user-friendly interface.

- **Ensemble-Based Disease Classification**  
  Leverages a powerful ensemble of deep learning models for accurate and reliable classification of skin conditions.

- **Symptom-Aware Prediction Refinement**  
  Allows users to select relevant symptoms, enhancing model performance and delivering more precise results.

```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up Python environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd src/frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the Python backend:
   ```bash
   python src/python_scripts/app.py
   ```
2. In a separate terminal, start the React frontend:
   ```bash
   cd src/frontend
   npm start
   ```
## 🧠 Models Used

The application uses two core models for skin disease classification and symptom-aware refinement:

- [**image_model_1.pth**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H1HZU5hNq6LvjyVLoXm-2_yfygvO-h1S/view?usp=sharing) — *PyTorch Image Classification Model*
- [**text_model.pth**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dHac-VhW215BtssW0myndJrVE27iWyz9/view?usp=sharing) — *PyTorch Symptoms Classification Model*

> 📁 **Make sure both model files are located in the `models/` directory before starting the backend.**

## Dependencies
- Python: Flask, PyTorch
- JavaScript: React, TypeScript
